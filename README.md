A complete SQL project analyzing Uber-style ride-sharing data with beginner to advanced queries including earnings, ratings, ride behavior, and location-based insights.
## ðŸ“„ Project Description

This project is a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of a ride-sharing dataset modeled after platforms like Uber. It includes over 50 SQL queries ranging from basic data exploration to advanced insights into driver behavior, passenger activity, payment methods, and location trends.

Key highlights include:
- Aggregations such as total earnings, ride count, and average fare
- Filtering rides by duration, distance, and fare thresholds
- Advanced subqueries and `HAVING` clauses for analytical conditions
- Real-world scenarios like identifying drivers who completed rides on their join date, or passengers who took rides from multiple pickup locations
- Percentage-based analysis of location distribution and fare changes

This project demonstrates strong SQL proficiency and problem-solving using realistic business questions, making it a great addition to a data portfolio.
